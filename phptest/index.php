                <p>Our objective is to provide free Internet searches of baptism,
                marriage, and burial records, that have been transcribed from parish and non-conformist
                registers of the U.K. FreeREG is a companion project to&nbsp;<a href=

                registers, to make their existing transcriptions available on FreeREG or undertake one
